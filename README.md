# Drag-Drop-Component-React-TS
So I've recently developed a drag-drop component in react-ts. It comes really handy in my projects!
# Installation
Download the zip file from this repository and extract it. then, drag `draggable.tsx` and `styles.css` to the `src` folder in your react project.
Or just use git clone on your `src` folder :)
